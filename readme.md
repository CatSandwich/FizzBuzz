# FizzBuzz
This one-file solution is my implementation of FizzBuzz, 
the interview question. As there are many, many ways to approach
this problem, I decided to take the approach of displaying my
code style as best as possible. 

I didn't want to go overboard, I simply wrote the program as I 
would if I wanted it to be scalable; no values are hardcoded and 
it's incredibly easy to configure new ones.
